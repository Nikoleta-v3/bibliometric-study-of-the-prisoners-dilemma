\begin{abstract}
    % The Prisoner's Dilemma is a well known game used since the 1950's as a
    % framework for studying the emergence of cooperation; a topic of continuing
    % interest for mathematical, social, biological and ecological sciences. The
    % iterated version of the game, the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, attracted
    % attention in the 1980's after the publication of the ``The Evolution of
    % Cooperation'' and has been a topic of pioneering research ever since.

    % The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on
    % Prisoner's Dilemma related research. This is achieved in two ways.
    % Firstly, we review selected pieces of work and partition the literature
    % into five different sections with each reviewing a different
    % aspect of research. Secondly, we
    % analyse a comprehensive data set of 3077 articles on the
    % Prisoner's Dilemma collected from five different prominent journals.

    % The questions answered in this manuscript are (1) what are the research trends
    % in the field, (2) what are the already existing results within the field,
    % (3) how collaborative is the field and (4) do authors influence the field more
    % compared to other fields.

\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}


As discussed in~\cite{youngblood2018}, bibliometrics (the statistical analysis
of published works originally described by~\cite{pritchard1969}) has been used
to support historical assumptions about the development of fields
\cite{raina1998}, identify connections between scientific growth and policy
changes \cite{das2016}, develop a quantitative understanding of author
order~\cite{sekara2018}, and investigate the collaborative structure of an
interdisciplinary field~\cite{Liu2015}. Most academic research is undertaken in
the form of collaborative effort and as~\cite{Kyvik2017} points out, it is
rational that two or more people have the potential to do better as a group
than individually. Collaboration in groups has a long tradition in experimental
sciences and it has be proven to be productive according
to~\cite{Etzkowitz1992}. The number of collaborations can be very different
between research fields and understanding how collaborative a field is not
always an easy task. Several studies tend to consider academic citations as a
measure for these things. A blog post published by Nature~\cite{nature_blog}
argues that depending on citations can often be misleading because the true
number of citations can not be known. Citations can be missed due to data entry
errors, academics are influenced by many more papers than they actually cite and
several of the citations are superficial.

A more recent approach to measure collaborative behaviour is to use the co
authorship network, as described in~\cite{Liu2015}. Using this approach has many
advantages as several graph theoretic measures can be used as proxies to explain
authors relationship. In~\cite{Liu2015}, they analyse the development of the
field ``evolution of cooperation'' using this approach. The topic ``evolution of
cooperation'' is a multidisciplinary field which also includes a large number of
publications on the PD. This paper builds upon the work done
by~\cite{Liu2015} and extends their methodology. Though in \cite{Liu2015}, they
considered a data set from a single source, Web of Science, the data set
described here has been collected from five different sources. Moreover, the
collaborative results of the analysis are compared to those of two different sub
fields.

Co authorship networks have also been used in~\cite{youngblood2018} for
classifying topics of an interdisciplinary field. This was done using centrality
measures, which will be covered in Section~\ref{section:data_collection}, here
centrality measures are used in order to understand the influence an author can
have and can receive by being part of an academic group. Furthermore,
in~\cite{alshebli2018} they look at the relationship between research impact and
five classes of diversity: ethnicity, discipline, gender, affiliation, and
academic age. These characteristics of the authors are not being captured here.
In future work these characteristics would be included in the analysis.

In this manuscript a comprehensive data set of literature regarding the PD,
collected from the following sources, is presented and analysed. The data set
has been archived and is available at~\cite{pd_data_2018}. The aim of the
analysis is to review the amount of published academic articles as well as to
measure and explore the collaborations within the field.

\end{multicols}

The data collection process is covered in Section
\ref{section:data_collection} and a preliminary analysis of the data is
conducted in Section~\ref{section:preliminary_analysis}. In
Section~\ref{section:methodology}, graph theoretical methods will be used to
ascertain the level of collaborative nature of the field and identify influence.
This type of analysis has been carried out in~\cite{Liu2015}. The novelty here
is to consider approaches not considered in~\cite{Liu2015} such as the
centrality measures of the network, and apply them to a new dataset. A further
comparison of the results are made, relative to two other sub fields of game
theory: auction games~\cite{menezes2005} and the price of
anarchy~\cite{roughgarden2005}. A temporal analysis is also considered. In
Section~\ref{section:results}, the results of the analysis are discussed.

\section{Data Collection}\label{section:data_collection}

Academic articles are accessible through scholarly databases. Several databases
and collections today offer access through an open application protocol
interface (API). An API allows users to query directly a journal's database and
bypass the graphical user interface. Interacting with an API has two phases:
requesting and receiving. The request phase includes composing a url with the
details of the request. For example,
\url{http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=abs:prisoner's
dilemma&max_results=1} represents a request message. The first part of the
request is the address of the API. In this example the address corresponds to
the API of arXiv. The second part of the request contains the search arguments.
In this example it is requested that the word `prisoners dilemma' exists within
the article's title. The format of the request message is different from API to
API. The receive phase includes receiving a number of raw metadata of articles
that satisfies the request message. The raw metadata are commonly received in
extensive markup language (xml) or Javascript object notation (json)
formats~\cite{nurseitov2009}. Similarly to the request message, the structure of
the received data differs from journal
to journal.

The data collection is crucial to this study. To ensure that this study can be
reproduced all code used to query the different APIs has been packaged as a
Python library and is available online~\cite{nikoleta_2017}. The software could
be used for any type of projects similar to the one described here,
documentation for it is available at:
\url{http://arcas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}. Project~\cite{nikoleta_2017} allow
users to collect articles from a list of APIs by specifying just a single
keyword. Four prominent journals in the field and a pre print server were used
as sources to collect data for this analysis: PLOS, Nature, IEEE, Springer and
arXiv.

The following series of search terms were used to identify relevant articles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``prisoner's dilemma'',
    \item ``prisoners dilemma'',
    \item ``prisoner dilemma'',
    \item ``prisoners evolution'',
    \item ``prisoner game theory''
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``auction game theory''
    \item first price auctions
    \item second price auctions
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Price of Sinking
    \item Price of Stability
\end{itemize}


and articles for which any of these terms existed within the title, the abstract
or the text are included in the analysis. More specifically, 23\% of article
considered here were included because any of the above terms existed within the
abstract, 50\% within the main text and 27\% within the title. As will be
described in Section~\ref{section:preliminary_analysis}, two other game
theoretic sub fields, auction games and the price of anarchy were also considered
in this work. For collecting data on these sub fields the search terms used were
``auction game theory'' and ``price of anarchy''. The three data sets are
archived and available at~\cite{auction_data_2018, anarchy_data_2018,
pd_data_2018}. Note that the latest data collection was performed on the \(30^{\text{th}}\)
November 2018.

\section{Methodology}\label{section:methodology}

The relationship between the authors within a field will be modelled as a graph
\(G = (V_G, E_G)\) where \(V_G\) is the set of nodes and \(E_G\)  is the set of
edges. The set \(V_G\) represents the authors and an edge connects two authors
if and only if those authors have written together. The co authorship network is
constructed using the main data set described in
Section~\ref{section:preliminary_analysis} and the open source package
\cite{networkx}. The PD network is denoted as \(G_1\) where the
number of unique authors \(|V(G_1)|\) is \authors and \(|E(G_1)|\) is 10397.
All authors' names were formatted as their last name and first initial (i.e.
Martin A. Nowak to Martin Nowak). This was done to avoid errors such as Martin
A. Nowak and Martin Nowak being treated as a different person.

Collaborativeness will be analysed using measures such as, isolated nodes,
connected components, clustering coefficient, communities, modularity and average degree.
These measures show the number of connections authors can have
and how strongly connected these people are. The number of isolated nodes is the
number of nodes that are not connected to another node, thus the
number of authors that have published alone. The average degree denotes the average
number of neighbours for each nodes, i.e. the average number of collaborations
between the authors.

A connected component is a maximal set of nodes such that each pair of nodes is
connected by a path~\cite{Easley2010}. The number of connected components as well as the size of the
largest connected component in the network are reported.
The size of the largest connected component represents the scale of the central cluster
of the entire network, as will discussed in the analysis section.
Clustering coefficient and modularity are also calculated. The clustering
coefficient, defined as 3 times the number of triangles on the graph divided
by the number of connected triples of nodes, is a local measure of the degree to
which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together
in a clique~\cite{Easley2010}. It is precisely the probability that the collaborators
of an author also write together.

In comparison, modularity is a global measure designed to measure the strength of
division of a network into communities. The number of communities will be reported
using the Clauset-Newman-Moore method~\cite{clauset2004}. Also the modularity index
is calculated using the Louvain method described in~\cite{Blondel2008}. The value
of the modularity index can vary between \([-1, 1]\), a high value of modularity
corresponds to a structure where there are dense connections between the nodes within
communities but sparse connections between nodes in different communities.
That means that there are many sub communities of authors that write together
but not across communities.

Two further points are aimed to be explored in this work, (1) which people control the flow
of information;
as in which people influence the field the most and (2) which are the authors that
gain the most from the influence of the field. To measure these concepts
centrality measures are going to be used.
Centrality measures are often used to understand different
aspects of social networks~\cite{Landherr2010}. Two centrality measures have been
chosen for this paper and these are closeness and betweenness centrality.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In networks some nodes have a short distance to a lot of nodes and
    consequently are able to spread information on the network very effectively.
    A representative of this idea is \textbf{closeness centrality}, where a node
    is seen as centrally involved in the network if it requires only few
    intermediaries to contact others and thus is structurally relatively
    independent. Here, this is interpreted as a influence. Authors with a high
    value of closeness centrality, are the authors that spread scientific
    knowledge easier on the network and they have high influence.
    \item Another centrality measure is the \textbf{betweenness centrality},
    where the determination of an author's centrality is based on the quotient
    of the number of all shortest paths between nodes in the network that
    include the node in question and the number of all shortest paths in the
    network. In betweenness centrality the position of the node matters. Nodes
    with a higher value of betweenness centrality are located in positions that
    a lot of information pass through, this is interpreted as the gain from
    the influence, thus these authors gain the most from their networks.
\end{enumerate}

In the next section all the metrics discussed here are calculated for the data
sets in order to provide insights into the field.

\section{Preliminary Analysis}\label{section:preliminary_analysis}

A summary of each of the three data sets used is presented in this section.
The three data sets are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The main data set which contains articles on the prisoner's dilemma archived at~\cite{pd_data_2018}.
    \item A data set which contains article on auction games archived at~\cite{auction_data_2018}.
    \item A data set which contains articles on the price of anarchy archived at~\cite{anarchy_data_2018}.
\end{itemize}

The main data set
consists of \totalarticles articles with unique titles. In case of duplicates
the preprint version of an article (collected from arXiv) was dropped.
Of these \totalarticles articles, \manual have not been collected from the
aforementioned APIs. These articles were of specific interest and manually added
to the dataset throughout the writing of Section~\ref{section:timeline}. A
similar approach was used in~\cite{Liu2015} where a number of articles of interest
where manually added to the data set. A more
detailed summary of the articles' provenance is given by Table~\ref{table:provenance}.
Only 3\% of the data set consists of articles that were manually added and 34\% of the
articles were collected from arXiv.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \input{assets/provenance_table}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Articles' provenance for the main data set~\cite{pd_data_2018}.}
    \label{table:provenance}
\end{table}

The average number of publications per year is denoted as, \(\mu_P =
\frac{N_A}{N_Y},\) where \(N_A\) is the total number of articles and \(N_Y\) is
the years of publication. The years of publication is calculated as the range
between the collection date and the first published article, for each
provenance, within the data. These averages are summarised in
Table~\ref{table:publication_rates}. Overall an average of 49 articles are
published per year on the topic. The most significant contribution to this
appears to be from arXiv with 16 articles per year, followed by Nature with 10
and Springer with 9.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \input{assets/rates_table}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Average yearly publication $(\mu_P)$ for main data set~\cite{pd_data_2018}.}
    \label{table:publication_rates}
\end{table}

Though the average publication offers insights about the publications of the
fields, it remains a constant number. The data handled here is a time
series starting in 1950, when the game was introduced, until 2018 (Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}). 
Two observations can be made from Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a steady increase to the number of publications since the
    1980s and the introduction of computer tournaments.
    \item There is a decrease in 2017-2018. This is due to our data set being
    incomplete. Articles that have been written in 2017-2018 have either not
    being published or were not retrievable by the APIs at the time of writing
    this manuscript.
\end{enumerate}

These observations can be confirmed by studying the time series.
Using~\cite{scipy}, an exponential distribution is fitted to the data from
1980-2016 (Figure~\ref{fig:fitting}).
The fitted model can be used to forecast the behaviour of the field for the
next 5 years. The forecasted periods are plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:forecasting}. The time series has indicated a slight decrease
however the model forecasts that the number of publications will keep
increasing, thus demonstrating that the field of the iterated prisoner's dilemma
continues to attract academic attention.

    \caption{Forecast for 2017-2022.}\label{fig:forecasting}
\end{figure}

To allow for a comparative analysis two sub fields of game theory have been chosen
for this work; auction games and the price of anarchy.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Auction theory is a branch of game theory which researches the
    properties of auction markets. Game theory has been used for years to study
    auctions and the behaviour of bidders~\cite{Shubik1971}. The earliest entry
    in our data set~\cite{auction_data_2018} goes back to 1974
    (Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries_ag}). Note that no articles have been added
    manually for auction games.
    \item Price of Anarchy is a concept in game theory which measures how the
    efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behaviour of its agents.
    There is a variety of such measures however the price of anarchy has
    attracted a lot of attention since it's informal introduction in 1999
    by~\cite{Koutsoupias1999}. Note that~\cite{Koutsoupias1999} has been
    manually added to the date set~\cite{anarchy_data_2018}
    (Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries_pa}).
\end{itemize}

A summary of both data sets, in comparison to that of~\cite{pd_data_2018}, is
given by Table~\ref{table:summary_other_topics}.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{assets/prelimanary_comparison.tex}}
    \caption{Measures of all three data sets.}\label{table:summary_other_topics}
\end{table}

The IPD and auction theory are popular topics and have
been studied for decades. A large number of articles have
been collected for both topics, \totalarticles and 3444 respectively. Though, auction
games have a larger number of articles, the IPD
has almost 300 more authors.

Auction games have an overall average yearly publication
of 93 articles per year compared to the PD with 49 per year. 50\% of articles
for auction games have been collected from the pre print server arXiv and no articles have
been published in PLOS.

Compared to these two topics the price of anarchy is a fairly recent one. Only a
total of 748 articles have been collected, however it has a large number
of 1229 authors. On average each paper has two authors. It has an overall average
yearly publication rate of 39 articles and the biggest contribution has been made
to Springer (37\%).

    \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}


\section{Analysis of co authorship network}\label{section:results}

As mentioned previously, \(G_1\) denotes the co authorship network of the
IPD. A graphical representation is given by
Figure~\ref{fig:g_one_network}. It is evident that the network is disjoint,
which is only natural as many authors write academic articles on their own. More
specifically, a total of \isolated authors only have single author publications,
which corresponds to the \isolatedpercentage (\%) of authors in \(G_1\).

There are a total of \connectedcomponents connected components and the largest
one has a size of \largestcc nodes. The largest connected component is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:g_one_cluster} and is going to be refereed to as the main
cluster of the network. There are total of \communities communities in \(G_1\).
The network has a clustering coefficient of 0.708, thus authors are 70\%
likely to write with a collaborator's co author. The degree distribution,
Figure~\ref{fig:degree_distrs}, shows that the average degree is approximately
\(4\). Thus authors are on average connected to 4 other authors, however there
are authors with far more connections, the largest one being 58.

In~\cite{Liu2015} the collaborative metrics for the ``evolution of cooperation''
co authorship network were reported. Though their network is of smaller size
(number of nodes 3670 \(<\) 5394), the collaborative metrics are fairly similar
between the two graphs (clustering coeff. \(0.632\) and modularity
0.950 close to 0.977), indicating that for the same field the same
remarks can be made from a different co authors network. How do these compare to other fields
and more specifically to other fields of game theory?

The auction games network \(G_2\), and the price of anarchy network \(G_3\)
are given by Figures~\ref{fig:g_two} and~\ref{fig:g_three} and their respective
largest cluster in Figures~\ref{fig:g_two_cluster} and \ref{fig:g_three_cluster}.
As stated before \(G_3\) is the smallest network. \(G_2\) appears to be
very similar to \(G_1\), however it's main cluster is larger in size.

    std \(=3.01\) and for \(G_3\): mean \(=3.38\), median \(=3\), std \(=2.90\).
    It is clear that these distributions are not normally distributed, which has
    also been verified using a statistical test. Moreover, the statistical difference
    of the medians has been tested using a Kruskal Wallis test. The medians
    of \(G_1\) and \(G_3\) are not significantly different, however they are
    are significantly larger than that of \(G_2\).}\label{fig:degree_distrs}
\end{figure}

Using Table~\ref{table:summary_other_networks} and Figure~\ref{fig:degree_distrs}
the following remarks can be made:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing to another well studied topic, auction games, the field of the
    IPD appears to be more collaborative. Due to the
    value of the average degree, authors in \(G_1\) are known to have on average almost
    one more collaboration than \(G_2\). A slightly lower cluster coefficient ($ .622 < .702$)
    of auction games indicate that it is less likely for authors in \(G_2\) to collaborate
    with a co author. This could be an influence of the nature of the field itself
    were not only mathematics but software engineering skills are vital.
    \item Regarding the price of anarchy, the measures indicate that the field
    is not as mature as the other two sub fields. There are no isolated authors,
    which is more of an indication of the time the field has been active. As a
    more recent field there had been better communication tools that enable more
    collaborations between researchers. The average degree as well as the clustering
    coefficient (clustering coeff.$=0.713$) of \(G_3\) is comparable to those
    of the IPD.
\end{itemize}

These results can be extended to the main clusters of each network, as shown in
Table~\ref{table:summary_clusters}. The metrics' values are fairly similar and
the size of \(G_2\)'s main cluster does not appear to gave any significant
effect; all the same conclusions are made.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{assets/clusters_comparison.tex}}
    \caption{Network metrics for largest components, \(\bar{G}_1, \bar{G}_2, \bar{G}_3\).}\label{table:summary_clusters}
\end{table}

The change of the networks over time is also studied by constructing the network
cumulatively using a yearly interval. A total of 64 sub graphs
over 64 periods, starting in 1950, were created and all the collaborative metrics
for each sub graph have been calculated. Note that years 1952 and 1953 have no
publications in our data set. The metrics of each network for each period are given by
Table~\ref{table:coll_cumulative}.
Similar to the results of~\cite{Liu2015}, it can been observed that the network \(G_1\)
grows over time and that the network always has modularity.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \begin{adjustbox}{totalheight=.8\textheight-2\baselineskip, width=\textwidth}
    \input{assets/cumulative_graphs_table.tex}}
    \caption{Collaborativeness metrics for cumulative graphs, \(G \subseteq G_1\).}\label{table:coll_cumulative}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \begin{adjustbox}{totalheight=\textheight-2\baselineskip, width=\textwidth}
    \input{assets/cumulative_clusters_table.tex}}
    \caption{Collaborativeness metrics for cumulative graphs' main clusters, \(G \subseteq \bar{G}_1\).}\label{table:clusters_cumulative}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

To better assess the change over time for each metric they have been plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:cumulative_networks}. The number of nodes, connected components
and the size of largest component have been normalised such that the trend between
the three networks can be compared.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Figure~\ref{fig:normalised_number_nodes} the normalised number of nodes,
    which is calculated by dividing by the total number of nodes in each respective network,
    is shown. A steep increase in the size of all three networks is spotted soon after
    2000. This could indicate that more data is available in the sources
    used in this work following the year 2000. It is however, definitely not an effect
    of a single field, as it is true for all three sub fields considered here.
    The sudden increase following the year 2000, is also reported by the
    number of connected components and the size of the main cluster, Figures
    \ref{fig:normalised_number_connected_components}, \ref{fig:normalised_size_of_cc}.
    A connected components represents at least one publication which means that indeed
    more articles were gathered from 2000 onwards.
    \item Auction games have been throughout time, less collaborative compared
    to the IPD. The average degree (Figure~\ref{fig:average_degree})
    and the clustering coefficient (Figure~\ref{fig:clustering_coefficient}) of 
    the cumulative sub graphs have been lower than that of \(G_1\).
    The only exception is during the years 2001-2008. For these
    year auction games appear to have had a more collaborative environment.
    \item In the price of anarchy cumulative graphs a sharp increase since the 
    beginning of the field can be observed for all metrics. There are not
    many data points due to the recent development of the field, however
    these steep trends could be an indication that game theoretic and potentially
    all scientific research has over time been more collaborative. This could
    be due to logistic and technical solutions.
    \item The high values of modularity throughout time is not true only for the
    network reported in~\cite{Liu2015} but also for all three networks of this
    field. Indicating that authors tend to create communities and write only
    with people from their communities and not others.

The cumulative collaborative metrics have also been calculated for each main
cluster, given in Table~\ref{table:clusters_cumulative}. As before,
the conclusions do not appear to change.

The next results discussed here are on centrality measures. As a reminder,
two centrality measures are reported, these are the closeness centrality
and the betweenness centrality. Closeness centrality is a measure of how
easy it is for an author to contact others, and consequently affect them; influence them.
Thus closeness centrality here is a measure of influence. Betweenness centrality
is a measure of how many paths pass through a specific node, thus the amount
of information this person has access to. Betweenness centrality is used here
as a measure of how much an author gains from the field. All centrality measure
can have values ranging from 0 to 1.

For \(G_1\)
the most central author based on closeness and betweenness are given by Tables
\ref{table:central_authors_cc} and \ref{table:central_authors} respectively.
The betweenness centrality of the
most central authors in \(G_1\) are rather low with the highest ranked author
being Matjaz Perc with a between centrality of 0.008, Table~\ref{table:central_authors}.
A publication of Perc's work has been briefly discussed in
Section~\ref{section:evolutionary_dynamics}, and the centrality measure suggest that the network is influenced by him.
He is connected to a total of 58 nodes and he has published to all five of the different
sources considered in the study. Though he also gains from his position
in the network, the gain is minor.

From Tables~\ref{table:central_authors_cc} and \ref{table:central_authors} it
can be seen that authors in \(G_1\) are more likely to affect their field instead
of gaining from it. This can be better explored by considering the distributions
of the centralities and by comparing them to other fields.
The distributions for both centralities are
plotted in Figures~\ref{fig:betweenness_dist} and~\ref{fig:closeness_dist}, and
in Figures~\ref{fig:betweenness_dist_cluster} and~\ref{fig:closeness_dist_cluster}
for their respective main clusters.

Regarding gaining from a network. An author is more likely to gain more
from the influence of the field if they were authors in auction games or the
price of anarchy. Though if it were an author in the main cluster it would make
no statistical difference in which field they were to published. Overall,
all the betweenness values are rather small and the distributions skewed to the
left. This could imply that in all three networks, authors do not gain much from
the influence of their fields.

        is not statistical difference between those two medians.}\label{fig:betweenness_dist}

In relation to influencing your field. An author is most likely to influence their
field if they write for the price of anarchy and authors that publish on auctions
game are more likely to influence compared to authors in the IPD.
Though if an author was to be placed in the main cluster of the respective
field they would chose to be in either \(G_1\) or \(G_3\).
In conclusion, authors regarding both influence metrics that have been defined here
are more likely to gain more if they were to published on either topics of auction
games or the price of anarchy. Though the value of gaining is actual small,
you are more likely to influence your field more in another field compared to that
of the PD.

\section{Conclusion}

The meta analysis which was covered in the second part of this paper explored
the number of publications, the authors collaborative behaviour and influence in
the research field of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. More than 3000
publications were automatically collected from five different sources using a bespoke
piece of software written for this purpose~\cite{nikoleta_2017}. A time
series analysis predicted a continuous growth to the number of publications in
the following years. Moreover, the authors of these papers were used to create a
co authorship network which was studied to compare the field to two other
prominent sub fields of game theory. The results of the analysis showed that the
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma field is more collaborative than the fields of
auction games and the price of anarchy. However, authors are less
likely to influence their peers.

Interesting areas of future work would include extending this analysis to more
game theoretic sub fields, to evaluate whether the results remain the same. The
study of the Prisoner's Dilemma is the study of cooperation, investigating the
cooperative behaviours of authors is what this work has aimed to achieve.
