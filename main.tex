\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}

The emergence of cooperation is a topic of continuing and public interest
for the social~\cite{capraro2014, gracia2012},
biological~\cite{Douglas2011}
and ecological sciences~\cite{Godfray1992,Krama2012,Milinski1987,Wilkinson1984}.
Cooperation is essential for evolution but according to Darwin's theory 
it is not always easy to achieve. The game called the prisoner's
dilemma offers a theoretical framework for studying the emergence of
altruistic behaviour.

\subsection{The Prisoner's Dilemma}\label{section:prisoners_dilemma}

The prisoner's dilemma a two player no-cooperative game~\cite{Flood1958} where 
the decisions of the players are made simultaneously and independently. Both players
can choose between cooperation (\textbf{C}) or defection (\textbf{D}).

The fitness of each player is influenced by its own behaviour, and the behaviour
of the opponent. If both players choose to cooperate, both do better
than if both defect. However, a player has the temptation to deviate. If a
player was to defect while the other cooperates, the defector receives
more than if both had cooperated. The reward for mutual cooperation is \(R\),
for a mutual defection they receive \(P\), and for cooperation-defection,
the cooperator receives \(S\) where the defector receives \(T\). Thus, the game's
payoffs are given by,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:the_pd_payoffs}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    R & S \\ T & P
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where \(T > R > P > S \) and \(2R > T + S\) are the conditions for a dilemma
to exist. Due to rational behaviour and the knowledge that an individual is tempted
to defect the game's equilibrium lies at a mutual defection and both players
receive a payoff of \(P\). Thus, the dominant strategy for the prisoner's dilemma
is \textbf{D}.

However, when the game is studied in a manner where prior outcomes matter, the
defecting choice is no longer necessarily the dominant choice. The repeated
form of the game is called the iterated prisoner's dilemma and now two players play
the game repeatedly. Interest was sparked on the iterated prisoner dilemma by
R. Axelrod and his book~\cite{Axelrod1984} ``The Evolution of Cooperation''.

In his book Axelrod reports on a series of computer tournaments he organised of
a finite turns games of the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Participants
had to choose between \textbf{C} and \textbf{D} again and again while having
memory of their previous encounters. Academics from several fields were invited
design computer strategies to compete in the tournament. The pioneer work of Axelrod
showed that greedy strategies did very poorly in the long run while more altruistic
strategies did better.

``The Evolution of Cooperation'' is considered a milestone in the field but it
is not the only one. On the contrary, the prisoner's dilemma has attracted much
attention ever since the game's origins. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline},
which illustrates the number of  publications on the prisoner's dilemma per year
from the following sources:

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item arXiv;
        \item PLOS;
        \item IEEE;
        \item Nature;
        \item Springer.
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The choice of sources is due to the fact that they have an open access Api, the 
process of collecting the data (including criteria for inclusion of papers) and
the analysis will be described more comprehensively in Section~\ref{section:analysis}.

Each point of Figure~\ref{fig:timeline} marks the starting year of a time period.
Each of these time periods is reviewed and presented in~\ref{section:timeline},
as an extensive literature review. This paper is the review of this type, in 
such detail since the origins to date.

Furthermore, in Section~\ref{section:analysis} a comprehensive data set of literature
regarding the prisoner's dilemma will be presented and analysed. This allow us to
review the amount of published academic articles as well as measure and explore
the collaborations within the field.

\section{Timeline}\label{section:timeline}

\subsection{Origin and (1961-1972)}

The origin of the prisoner's dilemma goes back to the 1950s in early experiments
conducted in RAND~\cite{Flood1958} to test the applicability of games
described in~\cite{VonNeumann1944}. Though in~\cite{Flood1958} the two player game was
introduced the name behind the game was given later the same year.
A. W. Tucker, the PhD advisor of J. Nash, in an attempt to delivery the game
with a story during a talk used prisoners as players and the game is known as
the prisoner's dilemma ever since~\cite{Tucker1983}.

The study of the prisoner's dilemma has attracted people from various fields
across the years. An early figure within the field is Prof A. Rapoport,
a mathematical psychologist, whose work focused on peacekeeping.
In his early work~\cite{rapoport1965} Rapoport conducted experiments using humans
to simulate a play of the prisoner's dilemma. Experimental groups were not been
used only by Rapoport but it was a common mean of studying the game
\cite{Evans1966, Gallo1968, Lutzker1961, Mack1971, Sensenig1972} and are still
being used to date. %TODO reference a good article with human studies.

Those experiments explored the conditions under which altruist behaviour emerges
in human societies. Conditions such as, the gender~\cite{Evans1966,
Lutzker1961, Mack1971} of individuals, the representation of the game
\cite{Evans1966}, the distance between players~\cite{Sensenig1972}, the start effect
\cite{Tedeschi1968} and whether the experimenter was biased~\cite{Gallo1968}.

Even though, several of these experiments were held and continuous research on
the topic was undergoing game theorists were still arguing with each other about
the best way to play the game~\cite{rapoport1965}. Inspired by the work of
Rapoport and intrigued by the very same question the political scientist R. 
Axelrod took upon him to identify the dominant strategy of the prisoners dilemma.
 
The main difference on Axelrod's approach was that machines were going to be used 
instead of humans. The issues with using humans, according to Axelrod
\cite{Axelrod2012}, was the fact that humans can act very randomly even though
the aim of the game is cleared to them. Thus, Axelrod was the first researcher,
to the author's knowledge, to perform a computer tournament of the iterated
prisoner's dilemma. The work of Axelrod is considered one of the greatest
milestones within the field. The tournaments and their results are discussed in
the next session.

\subsection{Axelrod's Tournaments (1981-1984)}\label{subsection:axelrods_tournament}

This section serves as a follow up from the earlier years of the topic and as an
introduction to the modern ways of studying the prisoner's dilemma. It is 
dedicated to the computer tournaments of Axelrod from 1981 to 1984. 

The first computer tournament was performed in 1980~\cite{Axelrod1980a}.
Several scientists were invited to submit their strategies, written in the
programming languages Fortran or Basic. There was a total number 13 submissions
made by the following researchers,

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item T Nicolaus Tideman and Paula Chieruzz;
        \item Rudy Nydegger;
        \item Bernard Grofman;
        \item Martin Shubik;
        \item Stein and Anatol Rapoport;
        \item James W Friedman;
        \item Morton Davis;
        \item Jim Graaskamp;
        \item Leslie Downing;

        \item Johann Joss;
        \item Gordon Tullock;
        \item Name not given.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

Each strategy competed against all the 13 opponents, itself and a player that played
randomly a match of 200 turns. This topology is called round robin and is the 
equivalent of a complete graph. The tournament was repeated \(5\) times to
reduce variation in the results. Each participant knew the exact length of the
matches and had access to the full history of each match. Furthermore, Axelrod
performed an preliminary tournament and the results were known to the participants.
The payoff values used where \(R=3, P=1, T=5\) and \(S=0\). These values are
commonly used in the literature and unless specified will be the values used in
the rest of the work described here. 

The winner of the tournament was determined by the total average score and not by
the number of matches won. The strategy that was announced the winner was
submitted by Rapoport and was called \textbf{Tit For Tat}. Tit for Tat, is a 
strategy that always cooperates on the first round and then mimics the opponent's
previous move. 

Examples of Tit for Tat interacting with deterministic opponents are given by 
Tables~\ref{table:tft_vs_c}, \ref{table:tft_vs_d}, \ref{table:tft_vs_a}. 
The opponents are, \textbf{Cooperator} a strategy that always cooperates, 
\textbf{Defector} an opponent that always defects and \textbf{Altenator} a 
player who alternates between cooperating and defecting.

\end{table}

The results of the first tournament were filled with surprises. Tit for Tat the
simplest strategy of all had won and had managed to defeat even entrants that
tried to improve on Tit for Tat after the preliminary tournament results. 
Axelrod justified the success of the strategy saying that the strategy was
`nice' and `forgiving'. 

The top eight ranked strategies have been strategies that never defected on the
first round, thus they were described as `nice' strategies. Compared to the rest
nice strategies Tit for Tat had also another property. That property was 
`forgiveness'. Tit for Tat punished it's opponent for a defection but just once
and then it would try to cooperate again.

These two properties were described to be the secret of success in a prisoner's
dilemma tournament. In order to further test the robustness of the results
Axelrod performed a second tournament~\cite{Axelrod1980b}. This time a total of
63 participants submitted strategies for the second tournament, their names were

All the participants knew the results of the previous tournament. The rules 
were similar to those of the first tournament with only one exception;
the number of turns was not specified instead a probabilistic ending tournament was
meant to be used. In a probabilistic ending tournament each match has probability 
of ending after each turn. This is  also refereed as `shadow of the future'
\cite{Axelrod1988}.

However, the tournament was not a probabilistic ending one. A fixed probability 
of  0.0036 was chosen as a chance of ending a match with each given move. The
value was chosen so that the expected median length of a match would be 200
turns. The topology was of a round robin and each pair of players was matched 
5 times. The length of the matches was determined once by drawing a random sample.
Each of the five matches had a length of 63, 77, 151 and 308.

The results of the tournament once again came as a surprise. Tit for Tat was the
simplest submission in the second tournament and won the second tournament as well.
Tit for Tat provided proof that reciprocity behaviour can allow cooperation
to emerge in the iterated prisoner's dilemma game. In~\cite{Axelrod1980a}
the main conclusions indicating strong performance was:

\begin{itemize}
    \item that it start of by cooperating
    \item it would forgive it's opponent after a defection
    \item after opponents identified that they were playing Tit for Tat choose
    to cooperate for the rest of the game.
\end{itemize}
%The strategies of the second tournament where bias due the first tournament. Discuss with V. 

Another successful strategy from Axelrod's tournament that can been seen
in literature to date is \textbf{Grudger}. Grudger is a strategy that will cooperate
as long as the opponent does not defect. The name Grudger was give to the strategy
in~\cite{Li2014}. Though the strategy goes by many names in the literature such as,
Spite~\cite{Beaufils1997}, Grim Trigger~\cite{Banks1990} and Grim~\cite{Van2015}.

As for the rest of the strategies, though a full explanation of all 14 strategies
is given in~\cite{Axelrod1980a} the same does not hold for all 63 strategies of
the second tournament~\cite{Axelrod1980b}. The author mainly focuses on the high
ranked participants and several details for the rest strategies are left unknown. 

However, the source code of the 63 strategies be found on Axelrod's personal
website~\cite{fortan_code}. The source code was written by Axelrod and several 
other contributors. The strategies written in Basic were translated to 
Fortran before the tournament. The source code includes the code only for the
strategies and not for creating and performing the tournament.Figure~\ref{fig:tit_for_tat_fortran}
serves as an example of the source code giving the code for the the winning
strategy Tit for Tat. Unfortunately, the source code of the first 13 strategies
is not available, as stated in Axelrod's personal website~\cite{fortan_code}.

So far it was discussed how the performance of the strategy was tested through
tournament against other strategies. But is the overall success of a strategy
based only on it's performance in a round robin tournament or should it be
checked through other ways as well?

Following his initial tournaments Axelrod performed an `ecological' tournament
in 1981~\cite{Axelrod1984}. In~\cite{Axelrod1984}, the set of strategies from
Axelrod's second tournament was used to perform the ecological tournament. The
63 strategies interacted generation after generation to a round robin competition
where their frequencies were proportional to their payoff in the previous round.
The ecological approach is based on the payoff matrix of the tournament. The
highest performing strategies are adapted by lower scoring individuals
within a fixed population. Over time a strategy takes over the population.
Figure~\ref{fig:ecological.tournament} demonstrates an example of the
natural selection proceeder. Four different strategies are being used by the
population, Defector, Alternator, TitForTat and Grudger. In~\cite{Axelrod1984},
the results showed that in a homogeneous population of Tit for Tat invasion by
mutant strategies was not successful.

The ability of strategies to be favoured under natural selection and their
ability to withstand invasion from other strategies soon became an new measure
of performance; refereed to as the stability of a strategy.

\subsubsection{Immediate work and Criticism on Computer Tournaments (1984-1993)}

The pioneer work of computer tournaments and the results on the reciprocal behaviour
of the prisoner's dilemma spread the knowledge of the game not only worldwide
but also across different scientific principles. The study of cooperation was 
once again a critical issue. This section focuses on the immediate research
that was spawn after the initial computer tournaments and on the criticism these
tournaments received from 1984 to 1993.

Ecological studies that made use of Axelrod's results include the 
works of~\cite{Godfray1992, Milinski1987, Wilkinson1984}. In\cite{Milinski1987}
an experiment was conducted using sticklebacks to test the robustness of the 
strategy Tit for Tat in the interactions of fish. Fish usually travel in pairs
and monitor their hunters to gain information on the enemy. The works of
\cite{Godfray1992, Wilkinson1984} looked upon food sharing between vampire bats.

Nevertheless success often comes with criticism. Axelrod's tournaments assumed that
each player has perfect information of the opponent's actions. In real life
situations this is not always the case. Colleagues' interactions often suffer from
measures of uncertainty. In the original tournaments there was no possibility of
mis implementation or misunderstanding. These stochastic variations are refereed
to as \textbf{noise} and \textbf{mis perception}. Noise is the concept of flipping
one's move based on a given probability. On the contrary, mis perception is the
probability that the opponent's current move is flipped before being recorded.
Noise will flip a player's action  and it will be recorded correctly in the history
where mis perception will not have an effect on the player's move but it will be
recorded wrong~\cite{Hoffmann1998}.

The performance of Tit for Tat was proven to suffer from such stochasticity in
the tournament environment, especially against itself~\cite{Bendor1991, Godfray1992,
Molander1985, Nowak1992}. If two strategies playing Tit for Tat were % Wolfgang2006
to compete against each other in a noisy environment the strategies will get 
a series of unwanted defections. In a non noisy environment
the two strategies would have been cooperating for the entire match.
An interesting result was introduced by~\cite{Molander1985}. Molander stated
that if two strategies playing Tit for Tat meet in a noisy match the average
payoff that a strategy will receive will be the same as that of a Random player
(with probability \(0.5\) of cooperating). 

In~\cite{Bendor1991} a similar tournament to that of Axelrod's was performed 
but this time noise was used. Bendor invited academics to submit strategies 
to participate in his tournament. A total of thirteen strategies were used 
including already existed strategies such as Tit for Tat and \textbf{Tit for Two 
Tats}. The results showed that Tit for Tat performed purely placing eight in
the tournament. Bendor stated that a more forgiving strategy was needed, in his
tournament a strategy called \textbf{Nice and Forgiving} ranked first.

The work of~\cite{Nowak1992} following a similar approach agreed with the result.
In~\cite{Nowak1992}, the space of re-active strategies was explored in a noisy
environment. The strategy that was performing the best in that environment was
the re-active strategy known as \textbf{Generous Tit for Tat}. Reactive strategies
are a subset of memory one strategies introduced in 1989~\cite{nowak1989}.
Reactive strategies are denoted by the probabilities to cooperate after a
\textbf{C} and a \textbf{D} of the opponent. Thus, a reactive strategy only
considers the previous turn of the opponent. Strategies such as, Tit for Tat and
Generous Tit for Tat are reactive.

The author published yet another paper a years later~\cite{Nowak1993} introducing another
interesting player. The new strategy had the tolerance of Generous Tit for Tat 
but also the capability of resisting and invading an all-out cooperators population
was. The strategy is called \textbf{Pavlov}, and is based on the fundamental
behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift. The strategy starts off with a
\textbf{C}, then Pavlov will repeat it's last move it was awarder with by
\(R\) or \(T\) but will shift if punished by \(P\) or \(S\). Palvov is a memory
one strategy.

Memory one strategies, are a set of strategies that consider only the last turn
of the game to decide on the next action~\cite{Nowak1990}. They are represented
by the four conditional probabilities \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) and
\(p_4\) to cooperate after \(CC, CD, DC\) and \(DD\) respectively
(the four possible states a player can be in if only the last turn of the game was
to be considered). Reactive strategies are just a constrained version where
\(p_1=p_3\) and \(p_2=p_1\). The first action of the strategy (when the history
does not exist yet) is assumed to be \textbf{C} unless is stated otherwise. For
example, a reactive strategy called \textbf{Suspicious Tit for Tat}, studied
in~\cite{Nowak1992}.

Other strategies that made an impact have been \textbf{Tit for Two Tats}~\cite{Axelrod1988},
\textbf{Handshake}~\cite{Robson1989} and \textbf{Gradual}~\cite{Beaufils1997}.
Presented in 1988, 1989 and 1997 respectively. Tit for Two Tats, is a variant
of the classic strategy which defects only if the other player defected on the
two preceding moves. Handshake is a strategy that starts with cooperation,
defection. If the opponent plays in a similar way then it will cooperate forever,
otherwise it will defect forever.Gradual starts off by cooperating, then after
the first defection of the other player, it defects one time and cooperates twice.
After the second defection of the opponent, it defects two times and cooperates
twice. After the \(n^{th}\) defection it reacts with \(n\) consecutive defections
and then two cooperations. 

\subsection{Evolutionary Dynamics (1987-1999)}

The results of the round robin tournaments were not the only ones to receive
criticism. Similarly, the ecological tournament and the statements for
the stability of Tit for Tat were also delved into by other researchers.
The results of~\cite{Boyd1987} argued that no pure strategy is evolutionary
stable in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. This was not proven analytically,
instead a series of examples using strategies such as Tit for Tat, Suspicious
Tit for Tat and Defector where explored.

The results were questioned by~\cite{May1987}, stating that much was
still no fully explored and more research had to be put into the results.
Another attempt to explore stability of strategies in the prisoner's dilemma
was done in~\cite{Boyd1989}. This time exploring the results in a noisy
environment, but similarly a analytical proof was not achieved.

An extension to the natural selection was introduced in the 1992~\cite{Nowak1992b},
recommending a different type of topology. A population of two deterministic
strategies, Defector and Cooperator, were placed on a a two dimensional square array
where the individuals could interact only with the immediate neighbours.
The number of immediate neighbours could be either, fourth, six or eight. As
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:topologies}. The authors claimed that the essential
results remain true of all topologies; the results also hold whether self interactions
are taken into account.

Thus each cell of the lattice is occupied by a \textbf{C} or a \textbf{D} and in
each generation step each cell owner interacts with its immediate neighbours and
play the game. The score of each player is the sum of the overall games the player
competed in. At the start of the next generation, each lattice cell is occupied by the
player with the highest score among the previous owner and the immediate
neighbours. Nowak and all created this model where the model parameter
has been the temptation payoff denoted as \(b\). Thus \(T=b\). For 
different values of the parameter \(b\) it was shown that cooperators and
defectors can persist together indefinitely. This topology is refereed to as
spatial topology.

Evolutionary dynamics have been highly useful in the research of the prisoner's
dilemma. In~\cite{Axelrod1987}, an evolutionary process, called the genetic
algorithm, was used to discover effective strategies. The author introduced
lookup tables as a mean of representing a strategy in a gene format. A lookup
table is a set of deterministic responses based on the opponents \(m\) last
moves; \cite{Axelrod1987} considered \(m=3\).

\subsection{Modern approaches (1995-2015)}\label{section:modern_approaches}

This section covers several pieces of work from 1995 to 2015. During this time
period several aspects discussed in the previous sections are now being applied
continuously and are considered standard means of researching the iterated
prisoners dilemma.

Several computer tournaments are performed, and new strategic rules surface.
The performance of these strategic rules is being measured by round robin tournaments
and evolutionary tournaments.
 
A number of Tit for Tat variants make an appearance and are introduced as more
as more dominant than Tit for Tat. These include, \textbf{Contrite Tit for Tat}
\cite{Wu1995} and \textbf{Adaptive Tit for Tat}~\cite{tzafestas-2000a}.
On the other hand, defector variants have also been studied~\cite{Hilde2013}.
\textbf{Anti Tit for Tat}, is a strategy that plays the opposite of the opponents
previous move. Another limitation of the strategy was discussed in~\cite{Wolfgang2006}.
Tit for Tat was proven to hit a deadlock. Deadlock meaning a loop between 
cooperation and defection. \textbf{Omega Tit For Tat} was introduced and was
a strategy capable of avoiding the deadlock~\cite{Wolfgang2006}.

In 2011 the authors of~\cite{Li2011} performed their own tournament where 
several interesting strategies made an appearance.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic player CCD}, plays \textbf{C}, \textbf{C}, \textbf{D} 
    periodically. Note that variations of a period player also make appearance
    in the article but will not be listed here.
    \item \textbf{Prober}, starts with the pattern \textbf{D}, \textbf{C}, \textbf{C}
     and then defects if the opponent has cooperated in the second and third move;
     otherwise, it play as Tit for Tat.
    \item \textbf{Reverse Pavlov}, a strategy that does the reverse of Pavlov.
\end{itemize}

In earlier work the same author introduced a strategy called \textbf{APavlov},
which stands for adaptive Pavlov~\cite{Li2007}. The strategy attempts to 
classify the opponent as one of the following strategies, All Cooperator, 
All Defector, Pavlov, Random or \textbf{PavlovD}. PavlovD, is just Pavlov
but it starts the game with a \textbf{D}. Once Adaptive Pavlov has classified
the opponent plays to maximize it's payoff.

Evolutionary dynamics and optimization methods are used with different representation
methods in order to discover new optimized strategies. Include lookup tables
\cite{Axelrod1987, Lindgren1994}, artificial neural networks~\cite{Fogel1996,
Lee2015} and finite state machines~\cite{Miller1996, Rubinstein1986}.

Strategies based on finite state machines are described by the number of states.
The strategy selects the next action in each round based on the current state
and the opponent's last move, transitioning to a new state each time. Figure~\ref{fig:tit_for_tat_fsm},
illustrates the finite state representation of Tit For Tat.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]

    \caption{Finite state machine representation of Tit for Tat.}
    \label{fig:tit_for_tat_fsm}
\end{figure}

In~\cite{Ashlock2006b} the author presented two new strategies that have
been trained using a finite state machine representation. They are called,
\textbf{Fortress3} and \textbf{Fortress4}. Figure~\ref{fig:fortress3_and_4}
illustrates their diagrammatic representation where the transition arrows are 
labelled \textit{O/P} where \textit{O} is the opponent's last action and \textit{P}
is the player's response.

     \caption{Representations of Fortress 3 and Fortress 4. Note that the
     strategy's first move, enters state 1, is defection for both strategies.}
     \label{fig:fortress3_and_4}
\end{figure}

Optimisation methods will return a spectrum of strategies. In order to distinguish
the strategies and assuring that they are indeed different \cite{Ashlock2005} 
introduced a method called fingerprinting. 

The method of fingerprinting is a technique for generating a functional signature for a 
strategy~\cite{Ashlock2008}. This is achieved by computing the score of a strategy
against a spectrum of opponents. The basic method is to play the strategy
against a probe strategy with varying noise parameters. In~\cite{Ashlock2005} 
Tit for Tat is used as the probe strategy. Fingerprint functions
can then be compared to allow for easier identification of similar strategies.
In Figure~\ref{fig:fingerprinting} an example of Pavlov's fingerprint is given.
Fingerprinting has been studied in depth in~\cite{Ashlock2008, Ashlock2009, 
Ashlock2010, Ashlock2006a}.

    \caption{Pavlov fingerprinting with Tit for Tat used as the probe strategy.
    Figure was generated using~\cite{axelrodproject}.}
    \label{fig:fingerprinting}
\end{figure}

Due the nature of the research several pieces of software are starting to appear,
this includes a library called PRISON~\cite{prison}. PRISON is written in the
programming language Java and it has been used by it's authors in several
publications. The project includes a good number of strategies from the 
literature but unfortunately the last update of the project dates back in 2004.

\subsection{Zero determinant (2012 - 2015)}

Following Section~\ref{section:modern_approaches}, this section is a review
of an important set of strategies, the zero determinant. 

In~\cite{Press2012}, a new set of memory one strategies were introduced, called
\textbf{zero determinant (ZD)} strategies. The ZD strategies,
manage to force a linear relationship between the score of the strategy
and the opponent. Press and Dyson, prove their concept of the ZD strategies
and claim that a ZD strategy can outperform any given opponent.

The ZD strategies have attracted a lot of attention. It was stated that
``Press and Dyson have fundamentally changed the viewpoint on the Prisoner's
Dilemma''~\cite{Stewart2012}. In~\cite{Stewart2012}, a new tournament was
performed including ZD strategies and a new set of ZD 
strategies the \textbf{Generous ZD}. Even so, ZD and memory one strategies have
also received criticism. In~\cite{Lee2015}, the `memory of a strategy does
not matter' statement was questioned. A set of more complex strategies,
strategies that take in account the entire history set of the game, were
trained and proven to be more stable than ZD strategies.

\subsection{Contemporary period (2015 - 2017)}

Following a discussion on research of short memory strategies this section
reviews recent work done in complex strategies. As well as a discussion of
new software and how modern approaches allows us to now revisit several pieces of
work produced in the past.

Modern approaches of artificial neural networks and machine learning are now used
in the field.  A number of strategies based on artificial neural networks are
introduced by~\cite{Knight2017}. Artificial neural networks provide a mapping
function to an action based on a selection of features computed from the history
of play.
 
These strategies are refereed to as \textbf{EvovlvedANN} strategies and are
based on a pre-trained neural network with the following features,

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Opponent's first move is C
        \item Opponent's first move is D
        \item Opponent's second move is C
        \item Opponent's second move is D
        \item Player's previous move is C
        \item Player's previous move is D
        \item Player's second previous move is C
        \item Player's second previous move is D
        \item Opponent's previous move is C
        \item Opponent's previous move is D
        \item Opponent's second previous move is C
        \item Opponent's second previous move is D
        \item Total opponent cooperations
        \item Total opponent defections
        \item Total player cooperations
        \item Total player defections
        \item Round number
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

A representation of \textbf{EvovlvedANN 5} is given in Figure~\ref{fig:ann_5_neural}. 
The inputs of the neural network are the 17 features as listed above. Number 5 
reefers to the size of the hidden layer.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includestandalone[width=.5\textwidth]{./assets/tex/ann_5_neural}
    \caption{Neural network representation of EvovlvedANN 5.}
    \label{fig:ann_5_neural}
\end{figure}

In~\cite{Knight2017}, these representing methods are refereed to as archetypes.
Finite state machines and artificial neural networks are included in the
work but also new archetypes are introduced, such as hidden Markov models. A variant
of a finite state machine that use probabilistic transitions based on the prior
round of play to other states and cooperate or defect with various probabilities
at each state. Finite state machines and hidden Markov models 
based strategies are characterized
by the number of states. Similarly, artificial neural networks based players
are characterized by the size of the hidden layer and number of input features.

Additionally a variant of a look up table is also presented called the lookerup 
archetype. The lookerup archetype responses based on the opponent's first \(n_1\)
moves, the opponent's last \(m_1\) moves, and the players last \(m_2\) moves.
Taking into account the initial move of the opponent can give many insights. 
For it is the only move a strategy is truly itself without being affected by
the other player. As a reminder, Axelrod in his work 
highlighted the importance of the initial move and believed that it was one
of the secrets of success of the strategy Tit for Tat.

Finally, a new archetype called the Gambler is also introduced, which is a 
stochastic variant of the lookerup archetype.

Archetypes are used with evolutionary algorithms to train set of 
new strategies. The evolutionary algorithm used in both~\cite{Axelrod1987,
Gaudesi2016} is called genetic algorithm. Other algorithms including particle
swarm optimization have been used in research of the most dominant strategy
\cite{Franken2005}.

In~\cite{Knight2017} the approach in used to introduce as stated
by the authors the best performing strategies for the iterated prisoner's dilemma.
These strategies will be refereed  as \textbf{Evolved} strategies.
Several successful new strategies are,

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{EvolvedLookerUp2\_2\_2} a looker up strategy trained with a
    genetic algorithm; EvolvedLookerUp2\_2\_2 responses based on the opponent's 
    2 first and last moves and the player's 2 last moves. Thus \(n_1=2, m_1=2\)
    and \(m_2=2\). 
    \item \textbf{Evolved HMM 5} a 5 states hidden markov model trained with a genetic 
    algorithm;
    \item \textbf{Evolved FSM 16} a 16 state machine trained with a genetic
    algorithm; 
    \item Finally \textbf{PSO Gambler 2 2 2} a looker up strategy trained with
    a particle swarm algorithm, where \(n_1=2, m_1=2\) and \(m_2=2\).
\end{itemize}

Though several papers have claimed before to have discovered the dominant
strategies for the game the work of \cite{Knight2017} is promising. 
This is due the fact that the introduced strategies have been trained using
different types of evolutionary algorithms in a pool of 176 well known 
strategies for the literature. Including all the strategies that have been 
discussed in this section.

This was made possible due an open source  library, called the Axelrod project
\cite{axelrodproject}. The project is written in the programming language 
Python, it is accessible and open source. To date the list of strategies implemented
within the library exceed the 200. The project has been used in several
publications including~\cite{Knight2017} and a paper describing it and
it's capabilities was published in 2016~\cite{Knight2016}. The source code
for Tit for Tat as implement within the library is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:tit_for_tat_axelrod}. Furthermore, performing a tournament 
with a selection of strategies is possible in five lines of code, shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:tournament_code}.

    \end{minted}
    \caption{\label{fig:tournament_code} Performing a computer tournament

\end{figure}

Software has a crucial role in research. Well written and maintained software
allows the reproducibility of prior work and can accelerate findings within the
field. The field of the iterated prisoner's dilemma has suffered the consequences
of poor research software. As stated above the source code of the initial
computer tournament is not retrievable. Several of the strategies that competed
in the tournament are not given a full explanation of how the decided on their
next move. In terms of best practice and reproducibility the Axelrod library
is the lead software in the field.

Other recent projects include~\cite{pd_trust, pd_game}, both are education 
platforms and not research tools. In~\cite{pd_trust}, several concepts such as 
the iterated game, computer tournaments and evolutionary dynamics are introduced
through a user interface game. Project~\cite{pd_game} offers a big collection of
strategies and allows the user to try several match and tournaments configurations.
Such as noise. 

In~\cite{Rapoport2015}, the authors claim that they have managed to 
re-run the first tournament that Axelrod performed. They tried to push his work
further by altering aspects such as, the format of the tournament, the objective
and the population. One of the authors claimed to have been a contributor
to the first tournaments, which would explain how it was managed to reproduce
the tournament.

\subsubsection{Biological Applications}
%TODO include the cancer studies.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Turner1999} uses evolutionary game theory to study the spread of
    virus.
    \item \cite{Douglas2011} a shout for his work, using tit for tat to study cells.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}\label{section:analysis}

This section follows a circumstantial review of the prisoner's dilemma timeline
conducted by the authors. It focuses on the analysis of the prisoner's dilemma
field using a large dataset of prisoner's dilemma articles' metadata.
The number of articles and connections of authors that work on the game are
explored. Moreover, the collaborations within the field are examined and compared
to other fields of game theory.

\subsection{Data Collection}

Academic articles are accessible through scholarly databases and collections of
academic journals. Several databases and collections today offer access through
an open Api. An Api is an application protocol interface that allows users to talk
directly to the database and skipping the user interface side of a journal.
Interacting with an Api has two phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item requesting;
    \item receiving;
\end{itemize}

The requesting phase includes composing a url with the requesting message.
The head of the url includes the address of the Api and the tail the search 
argument, such as the word `prisoner' to exists within the title. The address 
of the Api and the syntax of the search arguments differ from journal to journal.
Thus different journals can generate completely different requesting urls. 

The second phase is that of the receiving. This includes receiving a number of raw
metadata of articles that satisfied the requesting message. The raw metadata are 
commonly received in an xml format. Similarly the number of features and the
structure of the xml file differs from journal to journal.

Data collection is a crucial proceeder. We wanted to include a large number of
articles from various journals for the analysis to be objective. Moreover, we 
wanted the collection to be fast. For these reasons
an open source library was developed for the purpose of this work. The library
is called Arcas and though the package itself will not be analysed here the
source code is available online(\url{https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/Arcas}).

Arcas serves as a translator between us and various Apis. More specifically it
works in coordinate with five different journals. Arcas collects data based on 
a series of arguments. In the work described here, a series of keywords were given.
Each keyword individually was checked weather it existed within the title or the
abstract of an article. Only if this check was satisfied an article would be collected.
A list of the keywords that were used in this are shown in Table~\ref{table:search_keywords}.

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item arXiv;
        \item PLOS;
        \item IEEE;

Each entry retrieved by Arcas is consisted of various features which are 
listed on Table~\ref{table:arcas_results}. In the following sections only a number
of these features are considered. These are listed on Table~\ref{table:result_set}.
The search has managed to retrieve a number of different articles. The data set

\subsection{Preliminary Analysis}

The data set explored in this work is consisted of \totalarticles articles. Although only
\uniquetitles are unique titles. This is because a total of \numberofduplicates
articles have been collected from more than just one Api. All \numberofduplicates
duplicates are from the pre print server arXiv and will be dropped
for the analysis, thus hereupon we consider \uniquetitles unique article entries. The full
data set has been archived and is available online. % archived articles

Though Arcas was used to automatically collect data, in progress of writing the
literature review of Section~\ref{section:timeline} the authors have discussed 
a number of articles that were not retrieved by Arcas. This is only because these
articles were not published by the 5 journals accessible by the software. Even so,
the meta data of those article have been manually included, more specifically
\manual entries have been manually added to the data set. The overall provenance
of the data is given by Table~\ref{table:provenance}.

More specifically, a total number of 470 articles have been collected from arXiv,
312 from Springer and 241 from IEEE. A smaller number of entries were
contributed by Nature and PLOS.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \input{assets/provenance_table}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Keywords used in searching for articles.}
    \label{table:provenance}
\end{table}

The eldest article was published in 1944 and the most recent one in 2017. Note
that the last time data were collected was on December 2017. The provenance of
articles can also be viewed over the years. This is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:provenance}. This allow us to view the significance of each
journal's contribution to the field over the years as well as when the prisoner's
dilemma fitted the scope of each journal. 

Springer and IEEE are the two journals that have been publishing papers on the 
topic for the longest time. Even so, it can been seen that IEEE contributed more
than 10 articles per year after 2002. Similarly, arXiv contributes with a large
number of papers with an increasing trend after 2000. Both arXiv and IEEE
are associated with computer engineering and allied disciplines. As a reminder
from Section~\ref{section:timeline}, the `Modern Area' started near the 2000s
where now the study of the prisoner's dilemma is associated with computer science.
PLOS journal was launched on 2000 and it can been seen that accepted it's first
publication on the topic on 2006. Finally Nature has a few publications over the
years. Nature began it's publications after the work of Axelord in 1980s and
some of it's first publications include the work of Nowak done in the 1990's.

The number and years of publications that have been made on the prisoner's dilemma
have been discussed in this section. In the following section we explore
the people that have written about the game and their connections to each other.

\subsection{Authors Analysis}

In this section we present and analyse the authorship in the research field of the
prisoner's dilemma through a network analysis. A network is presented where each
unique author is represented as a node of the network and
a co-authorship is represented as an edge. Over the \uniquetitles articles of the
data set the total number of unique authors is \authors. 

Several different methods are being used from different journals for writing an
author's name. Consequently, several different entries of the same author existed
within the data set. In order to address the problem the Levenshtein Distance~\cite{miller2009}
was used. The Levenshtein Distance highlighted the entries with a small difference
between them. A manual check was performed to assure that both entries were in
did the same author and one of them was replaced by the other.

Once the network was constructed several network methods were used to perform an
analysis. The connectivity of the network and the trend of co-authorship within
the research field were explored. The number of authors per papers and fields
can vary a lot. Some fields tend to be more collaborative than others. Thus, we
use two other research topics and compare the results with those of the
prisoner's dilemma authorship network. Finally, a number of sub graphs are
examined more closely.

\subsubsection{Co-authorship network for the prisoner's dilemma}
\label{section:co_authors_network_analysis}

The authors are represented using an undirected network, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:authors_network}. The network has sets of vertices \(V\) and edges \(E\).
The \authors vertices represent each of the unique authors from the data. 
The vertices are connected with an edge if and only if two authors have written
together. Weights have been applied to both the vertices and the edges.

Vertices' weights corresponds to the number of publications an author has.
The ten authors with the highest number of publications are given
by Table~\ref{table:most_published}. Authors such as M. Nowak and D. Ashlock,
that have previously been discussed in Section~\ref{section:timeline}, appear on
the list. Though other authors such as R. Axelrod do not. On the other hand, 
several people whose work was not discussed in the previous section appear here,
for example Matjaz Perc with a total of 34 publications. The network once the 
vertices' weight has been applied is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:authors_network_weighted}.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./assets/images/co-authors-network.pdf}
    \caption{Co-authorship network.}\label{fig:authors_network}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \input{assets/most_published}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Top 10 most published authors.}
    \label{table:most_published}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./assets/images/co-authors-network-weight.pdf}
    \caption{Co-authorship network with vertices' weight.}
    \label{fig:authors_network_weighted}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the edge weight corresponds to the number of times the authors
wrote together. From Figures~\ref{fig:authors_network}, \ref{fig:authors_network_weighted}
it can bee seen that overall the co-authors network is disjoint. Several researchers
on the outer circle seem to have written alone or have a single connection to
another researcher. On the other hand, in the inner circle of the network some
connectivity of the vertices does seem to exist, with a single large cluster
located in the middle of the network.
 
The authors that cover the outer space, that seem to be less collaborative,
are not authors that have single contributions to the field. On the other hand
authors that have repeatedly published on the topic are located in both the outer
and inner circles of the network.

More insights can be gained by reviewing several network measures such as the
density, the average degree and centrality measures~\cite{bakshi2009}. The first
measure to be considered is the density of the network. The density of a network
is given by, \(\frac{2E}{V(V -1)}\) and is calculated to be 0.00163. The density
is defined as the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges.
Thus a small value as 0.00163 indicates that the network as a low connectivity.
Another measure closely related to the density is the average degree. The average
degree is given by \(\frac{2E}{V}\) and has been calculated to be 3.22. The
histogram of the the degree distribution is given by Figure\ref{fig:degree_hist_pd}.
The most frequent degree appears to be that of 2 degrees.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/degrees_hist_pd.pdf}
    \caption{Degree Histogram. Co-authors network of prisoner's dilemma data.}
    \label{fig:degree_hist_pd}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Furthermore we compute node centrality measures. Indicators of centrality 
identify the most important vertices of the network. There are several centrality
measures, for the purpose of this work the following are considered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item weighted betweenness centrality;
    \item closeness centrality;
    \item weighted page rank;
\end{itemize}

The results of the different centrality measures are given by Table~\ref{table:central_authors_pd}.
Though several differences between the ranks of the three measures are spotted,
some names appear to be on the most central vertices for all three measures.
These are authors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Matjaz Perc;
    \item Yamir Moreno;
    \item Arne Traulsen;
    \item Martin A. Nowak;
    \item Angel Snchez;
    \item Krishnendu Chatterjee.
\end{itemize}

In agreement of all measures the above are the most central authors of our network.
More specifically, the most central author is Matjaz Perc.

Though several insights were gained from studying the authorship within the field
we do not know how these findings compare to either fields. For example, an 
average degree of 3.22 means that the field is more collaborative than other or not?
These questions are delved into in the following section.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]

    \scalebox{0.8}{

    \caption{Central authors based on different centrality measures.}
    \label{table:central_authors_pd}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Comparison with other topics authorship}

In order to achieve objective insights regarding authorship in the field of the
prisoner's dilemma we perform a comparison in this section. We compare how well connected the
network of authors for the prisoner's dilemma is compared to other topics.
The data collected are on two different topics within game theory, these are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item price of anarchy and
    \item auction games.
\end{itemize}

The open source project Arcas was used again, this time using the following 
keywords respectively for each topic,

\begin{itemize}
    \item key: price of anarchy;
    \item key: auction game theory.
\end{itemize}

A summary of the two data set is given by Table~\ref{table:data_sets_summary}.
A total of 296 unique articles have been collected on price of anarchy. The 
earliest entry being in 2003 and a total of 668 unique authors have written about
the topic. In comparison, a total of 2103 articles are examined for auction 
games. Auction games are a well studied topic for several years with the earliest entry
going back to 1974. Finally, 3860 different names are examined. The frequency
of the prisoner's dilemma, for both articles and authors, lies between the frequencies
of these two topics. In Figure~\ref{fig:timeplots_anarchy_auction} a timeplot for each
topic is displayed and is exhibited that both topics have an increasing trend over
the years. Though price of anarchy is clearly a new topic compared to auction games.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{llr}
        \toprule
         &            Price of anarchy &  Auction games \\
        \midrule
        Unique articles      & 296  & 2103 \\
        Unique authors       & 668  & 3860 \\
        Min publication year & 2003 & 1974 \\
        Max publication year & 2017 & 2017 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Data sets summary.}\label{table:data_sets_summary}
\end{table}

\end{figure}
\end{center}


The immediate step is to compare the networks we have constructed for all three 
fields. The aim of the comparison is to gain insight as to how collaborative
the prisoner's dilemma authors are compared to other fields. Network measures
discussed in this comparison are given by Table~\ref{table:descriptive_networks}.
The smallest network is that of the authorship describing the price of anarchy,
followed by the prisoner's dilemma and the largest one is that of the auction
games. The average degree (calculated as \(\frac{2E}{V}\)), is for all three
networks is close to 3 and the density of all networks is very small, less than
0.005.

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
& Prisoner's Dilemma & Price of anarchy &  Auction games \\
\midrule
\(\mid V \mid \)                   & 1970    & 637 & 3968 \\
\(\mid E \mid \)                   & 3179    & 865 & 5713 \\
Density                            & 0.00163 & 0.00427 & 0.00072\\
Average degree                     & 3.22    & 2.71 & 2.87 \\
\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Descriptive measures of networks.}\label{table:descriptive_networks}
\end{table}

To further examined the differences or the similarities of these networks we 
consider the degree distributions. The normalised distributions of all
three networks are given in Figure~\ref{fig:degrees_dist}. They have been normalised
such that the frequencies sum to one. The distributions appear to be similar
but to validate the hypothesis a statistical test will be used. None of the
distributions is normally distributed thus the non parametric test Kruskal-Wallis
is used~\cite{mckight2010}. Kruskal-Wallis allow us to compare the medians of
two or more distributions. The test returns a \(p\)-value of 0.29. Thus, there is no
significant difference in the degree distributions of the three networks.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/images/degrees_histrograms.pdf}
    \caption{Degree distributions for all three networks.}\label{fig:degrees_dist}
\end{figure}

An interesting insight can be gained by examining the evolution of both the
average and the median degree over time. Though when the entire data sets are
considered the average degree of all networks is close to 3, when observing
the previous year this does not seem to be the case. The evolution of the 
degrees over the publication years of each topic have been very different.
This can be observed by Figures~\ref{fig:av_degrees_over_time} and
\ref{fig:md_degrees_over_time}. Auction games have had an increasing trend in
co-authorships over time. The prisoner's dilemma study, though it does have an
increasing trend has two sudden jumps. A decrease occurred in 1960 and a sudden
increase in 1970. Finally, the price of anarchy had a big increase in authorship
in 2004.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/images/average_degrees_lineplots.pdf}
    \caption{Average degree over time for all three networks.}
    \label{fig:av_degrees_over_time}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/images/median_degrees_lineplots.pdf}
    \caption{Median degree over time for all three networks.}
    \label{fig:md_degrees_over_time}
\end{figure}

Other measures that could highlight similarities in the connectivity of the graphs
are centrality measures. A summary of the maximum, mean and median centrality
value based on three centrality measures for all three networks is given by 
Table~\ref{table:summary_centrality_networks}. The individual histograms 
are illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:w_betweenness_hist},~\ref{fig:closeness_hist}
and~\ref{fig:page_rank_hist}. A normality test has been performed for each of the
9 distributions and with a significance level of 0.05 none of the distributions
is normally distributed. Thus, a Krustal-Wallis test will be performed to test
the mean difference between the topics for each centrality measure.

\end{figure}

The results of the Kruskal-Wallis tests are shown in Table~\ref{table:kruskal_wallis_results}.
It can be seen that for the closeness centrality the null hypothesis holds. Thus
there is not a significant difference of the medians. On the other hand, for
both the weighted betweenness and weighted page rank the null hypothesis is being
rejected. Thus there seems to exist a significant difference of the medians for these two
measures. A post-hoc test could be carried to further explore which medians 
are significantly different.

In this section the amount of collaboration within the field was examined.
Furthermore, to be objective this was compared to other topics within game
theory. In the section to follow we focus on the exploration of the co-authorships
within the field of the prisoner's dilemma. The collaboration of some well known
authors alongside authors that appear to be central in our network are explored.

\subsubsection{Sub graphs analysis}

In this section we explore and gain insights as to who well known authors within
our field tend to collaborate and write with. This is achieved by studying the
cliques of the network. Cliques are subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other. 
A total of 779 cliques exists within the network and the max node number of a
clique is 21. The clique with the 21 authors is from~\cite{Knight2016}.
Though a big number of cliques exists in this section we will only examine those
of authors that have been discussed several times within this work.

The first clique is that of R. Axelrod. The subgraph, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:axelrods_clique}, consists of 4 vertices, 3 edges and the edge weights
are all equal to 1. Thus for this subgraph we examined the betweenness, closeness
and page rank centrality (all without weights). The central node is Axelrod 
based on all centrality measures. The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:axelrods_clique}.

Furthermore, the density of the subgraph is equal to 0.5 and the average degree
in 1.5. All authors are connected to Axelrod with a step of one. That is because
all these authors have written only with Axelrod in~\cite{Axelrod1988,
Axelrod1984, Wu1995}.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./assets/images/Axelrod.pdf}
    \caption{R. Axelrod's clique.}
    \label{fig:axelrods_clique}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \toprule
    Author name &  Betweenness & Closeness & Page rank \\
    \midrule
     R. Axelrod          &    1.00 & 0.6 & 0.1734 \\
     J. WU               &    0.00 & 1.0 & 0.4797 \\
     William D. Hamilton &    0.00 & 0.6 & 0.1734 \\
     D. Douglas          &    0.00 & 0.6 & 0.1734 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Centrality measures for Axelrod's clique.}
    \label{table:axelrods_clique}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The next clique considered is that of D. Ashlock. The subgraph which contains
Ashlock is larger than Axelrod's one. It has a total of 24 vertices
and 38 edges. The density is equal to 0.137 and the average degree is 3.16.
Moreover, based on all three centrality measures Ashlock appears to be the most
central node of this subgraph. Table~\ref{table:ashlock_clique} present the 10
most central authors.

An interesting insight can be gained by observing the length of the shortest
paths for any author to reach Ashlock. The maximum shortest path is 4. Thus,
anyone can reach Ashlock at most with 4 steps.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/images/Ashlock.pdf}
    \caption{Subgraph that contains D. Ashlock.}
    \label{fig:ashlocks_clique}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \scalebox{0.8}{

    \input{assets/ashlock_closeness_centrality}
    \input{assets/ashlock_page_rank_centrality}}
    \caption{Central authors based on different centrality measures of the subgraph
    which includes author D. Ashlock.}
    \label{table:ashlock_clique}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The final two authors considered in this section are M. Nowak and the most central
author of the network M. Perc. It appreas that these two authors are in same
subgraph, Figure~\ref{fig:perc_clique}. This is the largest subgraph within the
network with a total of 266 vertices and 736 edges. Similarly, the centrality
of the subgraph was calculated using three different measures and the results are
displayed in Table~\ref{table:perc_clique}. The density is equal to 0.02088 and the average
degree is 5.533. 

The subgraph does not only include these two authors but also the rest of 
the most central authors that we indentified in Section~\ref{section:co_authors_network_analysis}.
These are,

\begin{itemize}
    \item Yamir Moreno;
    \item Arne Traulsen;
    \item Angel Snchez;
    \item Krishnendu Chatterjee.
\end{itemize}

Thus this subgraph is the most connected component of the intrire network. 
Similarly, the average steps of reaching each author is calculated. M. Perc is,
on average, three steps away from each node where M. Nowak is 4.

The short path that connects the two authors is also retrieved and is the following:
M. Nowak - A. Traulsen- Y. Moreno - M. Perc. Thus the authors that connect them
are two of the most central authors. 

The answer as to why these people are connected can be seen if we consider the
topic the have focused their research on. The common subject to all these authors
works is evolunationary game theory, spatial tournaments and social applications.

M. Perc is a signicant author within the topic with some of his most well received
and most citated works being~\cite{Perc2013b, Perc2008, Perc2010, Perc2013}.
Perc is well connected author which is proven from the connectivity of his
subgraph, the centrality measures and can be verified by his publications.

\subsection{Conclusions from the analysis}

In this section of the paper it was described how insights on the research of the
field can be gained by performing a data analysis. Initially the method that
was used to collect various metadata of articles was briefly presented.

Secondly, the number of articles and their provenance over the years was
reviewed. The number of articles appears to be gradually increasing after 2000.
That could be because most of the journals used in the data collection are either
recent or focused on computing/engineering sciences that have been used in the
field mainly after 2000.

One of the features retrieved by the collection is the authors name. Exploring
the connections of these authors has been the main focus of the section as it
provides several interesting findings.The aims of the network analysis have been,

\begin{itemize}
    \item to research how collaborative the field of the prisoner's dilemma is;
    \item indentify the most crucial authors of the network;
    \item explore several specific collaborations.
\end{itemize}

Researching the collaborative behaviour of the the field is achieved by examining
several network measures. The network was proven to be rather disjoint with a
very low density adn an average degree of 3. The median degree of authors has been
two, thus most people in the area are maninly writing with two co-authors.

In order to have an objective insights as to how collaborative the field is
two other topics were considered as separate networks. The topics have been the
price of anarchy and auction games. The results have shown that the collaboration
behaviour is very similar to all three topics. The average degreres of all networks
was close to 3 and all had a very small density. Furthermore, there was not a 
significant difference between the degree distributions of the topics.

However, the historical progress of the authorship is it significant different
between the fields. Auction games have been attracting more authors and collaborations
as time progresses. The price of anarchy is a new field that attracted a large
number of authors and parternshipd after 2004. The prisoner's dilemma seems to
be a more complicated, having a sudden decrease in 1960 and a sudden increase in
1970. Those this could be due the bias that this analysis suffers, which is that only
5 journals are considered. More insights can be brought in the analysis by performing
further tests.

A surprise has been that the main author that was highlighted several times
within the analysis has been M. Perc. An author whose work was not delved into
in the literature section. A number of authors such as Perc, Moreno and
Traulsen would have not come to our attention if this analysis was not held.
Thought their work seems promising and may be of interest to people that focus
on evolutionary game theory, spatial games and social stuff.
Thus advantages of such analysis is that authors that have not previously be
considered can stand out.

Another powerful results emerges by reviewing several subgraphs of authors.
The connections to an author of interest can offer new opportunities and guidelines
as to whose work to follow next. Nevertheless, only a small number
of the subgraphs were presented here. The reader is encouraged to explore
the extra material of this work and investigate the connection of their chosen
author.
