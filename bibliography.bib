 abstract = {How far can game theory account for the evolution of contest behaviour in animals? The first qualitative prediction of the theory was that symmetric contests in which escalation is expensive should lead to mixed strategies. As yet it is hard to say how far this is borne out, because of the difficulty of distinguishing a 'mixed evolutionarily stable strategy' maintained by frequency-dependent selection from a 'pure conditional strategy'; the distinction is discussed in relation to several field studies. The second prediction was that if a contest is asymmetric (e.g. in ownership) then the asymmetry will be used as a conventional cue to settle it. This prediction has been well supported by observation. A third important issue is whether or not information about intentions is exchanged during contests. The significance of 'assessment' strategies is discussed.},

By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the “making of new friends” may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited.},

The first game is an iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma that has relevance to decisions requiring trust while conducting business and involves a binary decision. The simulation examines one dimension of the Myers--Briggs personality type and its potential association with strategies that may be employed during an iterated version of the game, leading to different levels of performance. A web--based bot is used for such simulation. Results appear to support the possibility of exploiting personality type in this dimension in the context of similar circumstances.",

abstract="We study evolutionary spatial prisoner's dilemma game involving a one-step memory mechanism of the individuals whenever making strategy updating. In particular, during the process of strategy updating, each individual keeps in mind all the outcome of the action pairs adopted by himself and each of his neighbors in the last interaction, and according to which the individuals decide what actions they will take in the next round. Computer simulation results imply that win-stay-lose-shift like strategy win out of the memory-one strategy set in the stationary state. This result is robust in a large range of the payoff parameter, and does not depend on the initial state of the system. Furthermore, theoretical analysis with mean field and quasi-static approximation predict the same result. Thus, our studies suggest that win-stay-lose-shift like strategy is a stable dominant strategy in repeated prisoner's dilemma game in homogeneous structured populations.",

ABSTRACT={In social evolution theory, unconditional cooperation has been seen as an evolutionarily unsuccessful strategy unless there is a mechanism that promotes positive assortment between like individuals. One such example is kin selection, where individuals sharing common ancestry and therefore having the same strategy are more likely to interact with each other. Conditional cooperation, on the other hand, can be successful if interactions with the same partners last long. In many previous models, it has been assumed that individuals act conditionally on the past behavior of others. Here I propose a new model of conditional cooperation, namely the model of coordinated cooperation. Coordinated cooperation means that there is a negotiation before an actual game is played, and that each individual can flexibly change their decision, either to cooperation or to defection, according to the number of those who show the intention of cooperation/defection. A notable feature of my model is that individuals play an actual game only once but can still use conditional strategies. Since such a negotiation is cognitively demanding, the target of my model here is exclusively human behavior. I have analyzed \revise{cultural} evolutionary dynamics of conditional strategies in this framework. Results for an infinitely large population show that conditional cooperation not only works as a catalyst for the evolution of cooperation, but sustains a polymorphic attractor with unconditional cooperators, unconditional defectors, and conditional cooperators being present. A finite population analysis is also performed. Overall, my results provide one explanation of why people tend to take into account others' decisions even when doing so gives them no payoff consequences at all.}

Rather than assume each player having two alternative moves in the stage-game, cooperate or defect, a continuum of possible moves are available. Players' strategies are represented by feed-forward perceptrons with a single hidden layer. The population size and the number of nodes in the hidden layer are varied across a series of experiments. The results of the simulations indicate a minimum amount of complexity is required in a player's strategy in order for cooperation to evolve. Moreover, under the evolutionary dynamics of the simulation, cooperation does not appear to be a stable outcome."

If a player uses a partner strategy, both players can fairly share the social optimum; but a co-player preferring an unfair solution will be penalized by obtaining a reduced payoff. A player using a competitive strategy never obtains less than the co-player. A player using a zero-determinant strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between the two players' payoffs. These properties hold for every strategy used by the co-player, whether memory-one or not."
