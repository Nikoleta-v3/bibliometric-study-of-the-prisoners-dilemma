 abstract = {How far can game theory account for the evolution of contest behaviour in animals? The first qualitative prediction of the theory was that symmetric contests in which escalation is expensive should lead to mixed strategies. As yet it is hard to say how far this is borne out, because of the difficulty of distinguishing a 'mixed evolutionarily stable strategy' maintained by frequency-dependent selection from a 'pure conditional strategy'; the distinction is discussed in relation to several field studies. The second prediction was that if a contest is asymmetric (e.g. in ownership) then the asymmetry will be used as a conventional cue to settle it. This prediction has been well supported by observation. A third important issue is whether or not information about intentions is exchanged during contests. The significance of 'assessment' strategies is discussed.},

    abstract = {We study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game where players are allowed to establish new interactions with others. By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the “making of new friends” may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited.},

abstract="This paper explores utilization of bots created to play as participants in two games that have relevance in the field of economics. The first game is an iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma that has relevance to decisions requiring trust while conducting business and involves a binary decision. The simulation examines one dimension of the Myers--Briggs personality type and its potential association with strategies that may be employed during an iterated version of the game, leading to different levels of performance. A web--based bot is used for such simulation. Results appear to support the possibility of exploiting personality type in this dimension in the context of similar circumstances.",

abstract="Cooperation among nodes is fundamental for ad hoc networks. In such systems, there is no centralized control, and the network components require self-organize themselves to accomplish their individual and collective goals. These conditions make necessary include cooperation mechanisms during the network operation for improving the system capacity for solving problems through collective actions. In this article, socially inspired computing is used to propose a coalitional game based on the concepts of sympathy and commitment with the purpose of achieving emergent cooperation in ad hoc networks. The results show cooperation may emerge even in scenarios in which agents do not have a cooperative strategy, producing a better network performance and a suitable resources distribution.",
