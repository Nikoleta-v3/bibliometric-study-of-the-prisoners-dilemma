The first qualitative prediction of the theory was that symmetric contests in which escalation is expensive should lead to mixed strategies.

The second prediction was that if a contest is asymmetric (e.g. in ownership) then the asymmetry will be used as a conventional cue to settle it. This prediction has been well supported by observation. A third important issue is whether or not information about intentions is exchanged during contests.

    abstract = {We study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game where players are allowed to establish new interactions with others. By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the “making of new friends” may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited.},

By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the “making of new friends” may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited.},

The first game is an iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma that has relevance to decisions requiring trust while conducting business and involves a binary decision. The simulation examines one dimension of the Myers--Briggs personality type and its potential association with strategies that may be employed during an iterated version of the game, leading to different levels of performance. A web--based bot is used for such simulation. Results appear to support the possibility of exploiting personality type in this dimension in the context of similar circumstances.",

abstract = "Evolutionary programming experiments are conducted on a variant of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Rather than assume each player having two alternative moves in the stage-game, cooperate or defect, a continuum of possible moves are available. Players' strategies are represented by feed-forward perceptrons with a single hidden layer. The population size and the number of nodes in the hidden layer are varied across a series of experiments. The results of the simulations indicate a minimum amount of complexity is required in a player's strategy in order for cooperation to evolve. Moreover, under the evolutionary dynamics of the simulation, cooperation does not appear to be a stable outcome."

abstract = "Within the class of memory-one strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we characterize partner strategies, competitive strategies and zero-determinant strategies. If a player uses a partner strategy, both players can fairly share the social optimum; but a co-player preferring an unfair solution will be penalized by obtaining a reduced payoff. A player using a competitive strategy never obtains less than the co-player. A player using a zero-determinant strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between the two players' payoffs. These properties hold for every strategy used by the co-player, whether memory-one or not."

abstract="Cooperation among nodes is fundamental for ad hoc networks. In such systems, there is no centralized control, and the network components require self-organize themselves to accomplish their individual and collective goals. These conditions make necessary include cooperation mechanisms during the network operation for improving the system capacity for solving problems through collective actions. In this article, socially inspired computing is used to propose a coalitional game based on the concepts of sympathy and commitment with the purpose of achieving emergent cooperation in ad hoc networks. The results show cooperation may emerge even in scenarios in which agents do not have a cooperative strategy, producing a better network performance and a suitable resources distribution.",

abstract="The structure and evolution of co-authorship networks have been extensively studied in literature. However, the studies on the co-authorship network in a specific interdisciplinary field may be complementary to the mainstream of existing works. In this paper, the interdisciplinary field of ``evolution of cooperation'', which has been prevalent in the last decades as a promising scientific frontier, is analyzed by extracting its co-authorship network mainly from Web of Science. The results show that the development of this field is characterized by the growth of a giant component of its collaboration network. Originally formed by assembling a few local clusters, the giant component has gradually evolved from a small cluster to a structure of ``chained-communities'', and then to a small-world structure. Through examining the degree distributions and analyzing the vulnerability, we uncover that the giant component is comprised of the ``elite'', the ``middle-class'' and the ``grassroots'', with respect to the nodes' degrees and their functions in structuring the giant component. Furthermore, the elite and the middle-class constitute a robust cohesive-core, which underpins the modular network of the giant component. The overall results of this work may illuminate more endeavors on the collaboration network in other interdisciplinary fields.",

abstract="Social networks are currently gaining increasing impact in the light of the ongoing growth of web-based services like facebook.com. One major challenge for the economically successful implementation of selected management activities such as viral marketing is the identification of key persons with an outstanding structural position within the network. For this purpose, social network analysis provides a lot of measures for quantifying a member's interconnectedness within social networks. In this context, our paper shows the state of the art with regard to centrality measures for social networks. Due to strongly differing results with respect to the quality of different centrality measures, this paper also aims at illustrating the tremendous importance of a reflected utilization of existing centrality measures. For this purpose, the paper analyzes five centrality measures commonly discussed in literature on the basis of three simple requirements for the behavior of centrality measures.",

We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

This is particularly evident in top multidisciplinary journals, where a scientist is unlikely to appear as senior author if he or she has not previously published within the same journal. Here, we develop a quantitative understanding of author order by quantifying this {\textquotedblleft}chaperone effect,{\textquotedblright} capturing how scientists transition into senior status within a particular publication venue. We illustrate that the chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological sciences and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the case of high-impact venues, the chaperone effect has significant implications, specifically resulting in a higher average impact relative to papers authored by new principal investigators (PIs). Our findings shed light on the role played by experience in publishing within specific scientific journals, on the paths toward acquiring the necessary experience and expertise, and on the skills required to publish in prestigious venues.},
